## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

I used w3schools.com for addtional explanations on HTML and CSS.


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
The challenge that I encountered when creating this submssion was creating the github repository and uploading files to the repository. After following along through the video countless times, I began to stop and thing: Why isn't it working for me? I took a break and called some friends for help. They did not know about the internship, so I had to explain to them why I wanted to upload this particular project to github. After a couple of minutes, with the help of my friends, I figured out that all I had to do was upload only the .html, .css, and .js file. After I did that, it showed up on the repository. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
This was my first ever experience with web development. Before finding out about this great opprotunity, I always wanted to build my own website. I never thought my first website would be a game. After going through the tutorial, I wondered how large scale web pages such as Facebook.com, Amazon.com, and Walmart.com are developed. I wonder if back-end programming languages like C++, Java, and C# can be used for web pages. Whether or not I get this internship, I am confident that I can self-teach myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my own website by myself. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add the feature to record your own sounds for each of the buttons. The user can use a microphone connected to their computer and individually record a sound for each of the buttons. Another feature I would add is a random function where the program would randomly create a sequence everytime the user hits start. This makes the game a little more challenging instead of the same sequence over and over. A difficulty setting would be the final feature to the game, where the computer would speed up every sequence.
